# STEPS TO PUSH/PULL CODE
1. "git stash" to save your changes because they will be overwritten (ONLY overlapping files)
2. "git pull" to absorb everything in git repo in your local clone
3. "git stash show -p" to see 
	a) your added code that got overwritten (in green) 
	b) your other code that got deleted (in red)
4. Manually copy any of this code from terminal into corresponding files
	* now you are all synced up
5. "git push" to store your local repo in main repo
